                Asteroids, the silent sentinels of our solar system, hold the potential for catastrophic impact on Earth.
                Though the chances of a major collision are rare, the consequences could be apocalyptic, echoing the
                ancient impacts that once reshaped the surface of our planet and led to mass extinctions. Modern science
                allows us to track these celestial wanderers, yet many remain undetected, lurking in the shadows of space.
                Understanding and monitoring asteroids is not just a matter of scientific curiosity but a crucial safeguard
                against potential future disasters. As we stand on the brink of potential celestial calamities, the study of
                asteroids is not only about exploring the cosmos but also about protecting our own world from the unknown
                dangers of the universe. To better protect Earth, we have developed a model that helps us understand which
                asteroids could be dangerous. We share this information to help everyone understand the risks and what
                scientists are doing to prevent potential impacts. This effort is not just about studying space but also
                about keeping our planet safe.
